# Submit reports to Impact&trade;

Once your administrator has configured the reporting requirements for your organisation, you will be able to submit reports to Impact&trade;. On your main Dashboard, you will have the ability to browse between the different programmes of your organisation. For each programme, you will find Activities that have been created for this programme. You will see the most recent reports created. You can submit a new report by clicking on "Add Record".

All reports require a time and location. The additional fields will be based on the configurations done by your Impact&trace; administrator. All fields are currently required.
